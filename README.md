Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Excel: Used for the entire data lifecycle, including:

Data Cleaning & Processing: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data consistency.

Data Analysis: Utilizing Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, and other advanced functions to aggregate and analyze data.

Data Visualization: Creating an interactive dashboard with slicers, charts, and graphs to present the findings.

Data Analysis Process

Data Cleaning: The initial dataset (Vrinda Store Data Analysis.csv) was inspected for inconsistencies. Columns were formatted to their correct data types, and blank or null values were handled appropriately.

Data Processing: New columns, such as "Age Group," were used to segment the data for a more granular analysis.

Analysis & Visualization: Pivot tables were created to summarize the data and answer the key business questions. The results were then visualized using various charts (bar, pie, line) to build a comprehensive and interactive dashboard.

Key Findings & Insights

The analysis revealed several important trends:

Top Performing Month: January was the highest-performing month, indicating a strong start to the year or a successful post-holiday sales period.

Leading Sales Channel: Myntra emerged as the most significant sales channel, suggesting a strong partnership and customer base on that platform.

Top Performing State: Maharashtra is the leading state in terms of sales revenue, making it a critical market for the business.

Primary Customer Base: The data suggests that women are the primary customers, contributing the most to sales.

Order Fulfillment: The majority of orders were successfully delivered, indicating an efficient and reliable fulfillment process.

These insights can help Vrinda Store focus its marketing efforts, optimize its channel strategy, and make informed decisions to boost sales and customer satisfaction.
